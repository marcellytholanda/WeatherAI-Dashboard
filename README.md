# WeatherAI-Dashboard
WeatherAI-Dashboard is a repository that showcases an interactive dashboard developed to visualize real-time climate data and generate predictions using Artificial Intelligence (AI). While the full dashboard code is not available for execution here, this repository contains images and videos demonstrating its functionality.

## Dashboard Presentation
This repository includes screenshots and videos of the WeatherAI-Dashboard in action, illustrating its interactive interface and how it displays climate data along with AI-based predictions.

## Contributing
This repository is not open for direct code contributions. However, you can share suggestions or improvements through issues or pull requests. Feel free to contribute ideas or enhancements to the project.

## Dashboard Explanation
The WeatherAI-Dashboard is designed to visualize climate data and provide insights into the ongoing impacts of climate change. It incorporates real-time climate data, with a specific focus on how temperature and other climate variables are projected to change over time, based on information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

## Climate Change Projections
According to the IPCC, the average global temperature is expected to rise between 1.1°C and 5.4°C by 2100 due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases, primarily from human activities. The dashboard visualizes the following projections:

By 2050, the global temperature is projected to increase by about 1.5°C.
By 2100, the global temperature is expected to rise by 2–4°C.
These projections are crucial for understanding how the planet's climate will evolve, as well as the potential impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and human infrastructure.

## Contributing Factors to Climate Change
The dashboard highlights the main factors contributing to climate change:

Greenhouse Gases: Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping gases are primarily responsible for global warming. The dashboard provides insights into the levels of these gases and their impact on rising global temperatures.
Human Activities: Industrial processes, transportation, and agriculture are the main human-driven activities releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming.

## IPCC Reports on Climate Change
The dashboard also references key findings from IPCC reports, including the Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The report discusses:

The impacts of climate change on energy, urban, infrastructure, and industrial systems.
How climate change interacts with sustainable development, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation and adaptation strategies.
By providing these insights, the WeatherAI-Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for visualizing climate data, understanding trends, and raising awareness about the urgent need to address climate change.
