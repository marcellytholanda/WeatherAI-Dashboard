# WeatherAI-Dashboard
WeatherAI-Dashboard is a repository that showcases an interactive dashboard developed to visualize real-time climate data and generate predictions using Artificial Intelligence. Although the full dashboard code is not available for execution here, this repository contains images and videos demonstrating its functionality.

# Dashboard Presentation
In this repository, you’ll find screenshots and videos of the WeatherAI-Dashboard in action, showing its interactive interface and how it displays climate data and AI-based predictions.

# Contributing
This repository is not open for direct code contributions, but you can share suggestions or improvements through issues or pull requests. Feel free to contribute ideas or enhancements to the project.



# Dashboard Explanation
The WeatherAI-Dashboard is designed to visualize climate data and provide insights into the ongoing impacts of climate change. The dashboard incorporates real-time climate data, with a specific focus on how temperature and other climate variables are projected to change over time, based on information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

## Climate Change Projections
According to the IPCC, the average global temperature is expected to rise between 1.1°C and 5.4°C by 2100 due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases, primarily from human activities. The dashboard visualizes the following projections:

By 2050, the global temperature is projected to increase by about 1.5°C.
By 2100, the global temperature is expected to increase by 2–4°C.
These projections are critical for understanding how our planet's climate will change and its potential impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and human infrastructure.

## Contributing Factors to Climate Change
The dashboard also highlights the key factors contributing to climate change:

Greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping gases are primarily responsible for the warming of our planet. The dashboard provides insights into the levels of these gases and their impact on global temperature rise.
Human activities: Industrial processes, transportation, and agriculture are the main human-driven activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which contribute to global warming.

## IPCC Reports on Climate Change
The dashboard also references key findings from IPCC reports, including the Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The report outlines the following:

The impacts of climate change on energy, urban, infrastructure, and industrial systems.
How climate change interacts with sustainable development, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation and adaptation strategies.
By providing these insights, the WeatherAI-Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for visualizing climate data, understanding trends, and raising awareness about the critical need to address climate change.
